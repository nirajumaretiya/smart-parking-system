## 📋 Overview
A modern smart parking system that uses Raspberry Pi to detect parking spot availability in real-time. The system provides visual feedback through LEDs and a web interface, making it easy for users to find available parking spots.

## ✨ Features
- 🎯 Real-time parking spot detection using ultrasonic sensors
- 💡 Visual LED indicators (Red for occupied, Green for available)
- 🌐 Web interface for remote monitoring
- 💾 Database storage for parking history
- 📊 Easy-to-use dashboard
- 🔄 Automatic status updates
- 📱 Mobile-responsive design

## 🔄 System Flow
1. **Hardware Detection**
   - Ultrasonic sensor continuously monitors parking spot
   - Detects presence/absence of vehicles
   - Updates LED status accordingly

2. **Data Processing**
   - Sensor data is processed in real-time
   - Status is stored in SQLite database
   - Updates are pushed to web interface

3. **User Interface**
   - Web dashboard shows parking spot status
   - Real-time updates every 5 seconds
   - Color-coded display (Red/Green)
